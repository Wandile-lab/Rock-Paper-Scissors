# Rock-Paper-Scissors
## Project Overview

This is a basic Rock Paper Scissors game where the player can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors and play against the computer. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices, and the winner is determined by the classic rules of the game:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

The game ends with the announcement of the winner after a round.

## How to Play
1. Choose your move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer will randomly choose its move.
3. The game will determine the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
4. The result will be displayed on the screen (you can also show stats like the number of rounds played or win/loss record).
